# The Aggressive Cow Problem
Given the problem laid out in Assessment_Brief_TASK-A I have identified three main stages I intended to go though to tackle the problem. 

1. Determine the business logic to apply to the problem. 
2. Write unit tests. The breif suggests two functions and we may only add a couple more to apply our business logic so the aim will be for 100 coverage on tests. 
3. Write and analyse the python code.
